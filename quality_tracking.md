## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. OAuth token security
2. Encryption key management
3. Hardware wallet integration complexity
4. Backward compatibility breaks
5. Trezor Suite compatibility issues

### Mitigation Strategies
- Security review before each phase
- Extensive testing with real hardware
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Maintain separate legacy code paths
- Cross-test with Trezor Suite regularly
