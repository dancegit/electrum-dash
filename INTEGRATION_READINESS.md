**Last Updated**: 2025-07-28 21:07  
**Integration Lead**: Project Manager

## üìä Current Status

### Branch Availability
| Agent | Branch | Status | Last Commit |
|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Tester | fix/test-improvements | ‚úÖ READY | Fix test improvements from GitHub Copilot feedback |
| TestRunner | fix/security-eval-vulnerability | ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS | - |
| Developer | fix/slip015-qt-improvements | ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS | - |

### Critical Security Status
‚ö†Ô∏è **SECURITY ALERT**: eval() still detected in codebase
- `run_phase1_tests_direct.py` - CRITICAL (TestRunner fixing)
- `electrum_dash/gui/qt/console.py` - May be legitimate REPL usage

### Time Status
- **Current**: 21:07
- **Security Deadline**: 21:35 (28 minutes remaining)
- **All Fixes Deadline**: 23:05 (1h 58m remaining)

## ‚úÖ Integration Checklist

### Pre-Integration (Before 23:05)
- [x] Integration plan documented
- [x] PR body template prepared
- [x] Progress monitoring script created
- [x] Tester fixes received and verified
- [ ] TestRunner security fix received (DUE 21:35)
- [ ] Developer compliance fixes received (DUE 23:05)
- [ ] All branches fetched and verified

### Integration Phase (23:05)
- [ ] Create integration/copilot-fixes branch
- [ ] Merge fix/security-eval-vulnerability
- [ ] Merge fix/slip015-qt-improvements
- [ ] Merge fix/test-improvements
- [ ] Resolve any conflicts
- [ ] Run verification tests
- [ ] Confirm eval() eliminated
- [ ] Verify SLIP-0015 compliance

### PR Creation (23:20)
- [ ] Push integration branch
- [ ] Create PR with prepared body
- [ ] Verify PR details correct
- [ ] Request Copilot re-review (optional)

### Completion (23:25)
- [ ] Auto-merge PR with --admin
- [ ] Verify merge successful
- [ ] Update tracking documents
- [ ] Notify all agents

## üéØ Key Priorities

1. **CRITICAL**: TestRunner must deliver security fix by 21:35
2. **HIGH**: Developer's SLIP-0015 compliance by 23:05
3. **COMPLETE**: Tester's improvements already delivered

## üìù Notes

- Tester has shown excellent velocity - first to complete!
- Security fix is absolutely critical - no integration without it
- Console.py eval() may be legitimate for REPL - verify with Developer

## üö® Risk Mitigation

If TestRunner misses 21:35 deadline:
1. Check their worktree for WIP
2. Assist with security fix if needed
3. Consider emergency PM intervention

If Developer misses 23:05 deadline:
1. Can potentially defer Qt fix to Phase 4
2. SLIP-0015 compliance is non-negotiable
